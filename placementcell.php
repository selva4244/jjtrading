The aim of the cell is to find &ldquo;Right Job for the Right candidate&rdquo;. We are moving towards the &ldquo;<span style="color: #F4A460;">EXCELLENCE IN CAREER GUIDANCE AND 100% PLACEMENT</span>&rdquo;. Training and Placement cell interacts with reputed organizations for arranging campus interviews for the placement of final year students. It makes efforts to send most of the students for in-plant training to enhance their technical ability and gain exposure in the practical world. Various activities are carried out to final year students to take up competitive examinations. The placement season runs through the course of the year commencing the last week of July through to March. Pre-Placement Talks are also conducted in this regard as per mutual convenience. Job offers, dates of interviews, selection of candidates etc. are announced through the Training &amp; Placement Office</p>
